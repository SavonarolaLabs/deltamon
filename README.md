Deltamon is a turn-based RPG card game where players select creatures, position them on a board, and use abilities to battle based on initiative. The game features mechanics such as skill selection, HP management, buffs/debuffs, and elemental effects like fire and ice, with both active and passive abilities influencing gameplay. The most fun part - creatures evolve.
